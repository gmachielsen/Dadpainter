# Dadpainter is a website for my dad who is an artist. The website has the aim to provide visitors information about it's artwork en specialsm and to generate leads. Therefore the website is build up by a mainpage, which provides an overview of what my dad is painting and what he can offer and what visitors can do if they are interested to get a painting from my dad. Within the mainpage I have seperated topics, such as dogs, horses, portraits, landscape, stillife and birds. Those topics are developed as a thumbnail. Visitors have the possibility to click on one of those thumbnails to get more information and to see pictures of different topics my dad is painting. Each click on a thumbnail will lead to a new html page. Which is designed for a mobile version and a desktopversion. The reason why I have made every specialism in a seperated html file is that it is better for search engine optimalisation and last it is much more structured. The main reason why I have developed a mainpage is to provide a simple overview and to prevent that customers get an overload of information.
