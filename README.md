# Dadpainter is a website for my dad who is an artist. The website has the aim to provide visitors information about my dad's artwork en specialsm. The aim of the website is to generate customers and provide information. Therefore the website is build up by a mainpage, which provides an overview of what my dad is painting and what he can offer and what visitors can do if they are interested to get a painting from my dad. Within the mainpage I have seperated topics, such as dogs, horses, portraits, landscape, stillife and birds. Those are developed as a thumbnail. Visitors have the possibility to click on of those thumbnails to get more information and pictures of different topics my dad is painting. Each click on a thumbnail will lead to a new html page. Which is designed for a mobile version and a desktopversion.
